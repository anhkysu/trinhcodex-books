Suppose we had an algorithm that took in an array of strings, sorted each string, and then sorted the full 
array. What would the runtime be?


someFunc(arrayOfStrings){
    - sort string element
    - sort the full array
}

What is the runtime of someFunc?

- array length: n
- longest string length: L

=> sort string element takes: O(L*logL);
=> A job: sort n string elements takes: O(n*L*logL);
=> B job: sort this array of strings takes: O(n*logn). If string element comparison (deep comparison) is taken into account, each string comparison takes O(L) time => B job takes O(n*L*logn)
=> do A then do B => addition A + B

=> someFunc algorithm takes: O(n*L*(logL + logn));
