// Find an element in an unbalanced binary search tree.
// What is the runtime of this function



// Answer:
// Call N as the number of nodes in the unbalanced search tree
// The worst case would be like that the tree has N nodes of N depth,
// each node has only one child running straight down.
// The runtime in this case would be: O(N)
